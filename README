WHAT IS UCLATHES?
-----------------

This package is a beta test version of a LaTeX2e document
style to format UCLA dissertations and theses.
This style is based on work from Leslie Lamport,
Dorab Patel, Eduardo Krell, Richard B. Wales, and John Heidemann.

This version should be considered ``beta test'' because
no thesis formatted with it has yet been submitted to the Thesis
and Dissertations Advisor for approval.  Before you throw it away,
several theses and dissertations have been approved based on an
earlier version of this style package for LaTeX 2.09.  Degrees
were granted, so don't lose all hope.


WHAT IS IN UCLATHES?
--------------------

Enclosed in this package are the following files:


    uclathes.cls, uclath12.clo, uclathti.clo
	These three files implement the LaTeX2e "uclathes" document class.

    uclathes.bst
	This file implements the BibTeX "uclathes" bibliography style.

    thesdoc.tex, thesdoc.ps
	A document describing the "uclathes" style material.

    demo.tex, demo.ps
	The "demo thesis" described in thesdoc.tex.

    README
	The file you are now reading.


HOW TO INSTALL UCLATHES
-----------------------

The simplest way to install uclathes is to copy *.cls, *.clo, and *.bst
into the directory where you run LaTeX.

Alternatively, you can copy these files into wherever LaTeX looks
for its inputs.


WHERE'S THE REAL DOCUMENTATION
------------------------------

Rich Wales has prepared a good manual for uclathes.
Read thesdoc.ps (or format and read thesdoc.tex) before
proceeding.

WHAT TO DO ABOUT BUGS
---------------------

If a thesis formatted with uclathes is rejected by the
Theses and Dissertations Advisor, please let me know
and I will update it accordingly.

The uclathes package is for LaTeX2e.  If you're running LaTeX 2.09,
you should use the package "thesis.tar" (also available from
<URL:http://www.cs.ucla.edu/ficus-members/johnh/latex.html>) instead.

Finally, if you successfully prepare your thesis with uclathes, please
send me some e-mail to let me know that my work was not in vain.
